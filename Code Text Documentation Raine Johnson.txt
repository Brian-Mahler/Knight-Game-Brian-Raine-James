Director Documentation: Focused on getting everyone on the same page in terms of being able to push and commit their files onto GitHub.
Made sure everyone knew their roles and tried to help them to the best of my ability.

Tech Lead Documentation: Matched up scrambled code with each of the scripts so that it would run properly. Made sure code interacted with sprites and the flies moved properly.
